        <q-card-section>
          <div>I am Mayank Patel (Known as mayank091193). I am in the programming field since 2011. I always wanted to
            become
            a skilled programmer. My passion to become a full-stack developer increases as I started working at my first
            job in Vadodara, Gujarat.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>
            I started my career with HTML/CSS as the front-end and ASP.NET C#. In the initial stage, I was working on 3
            tier architecture that our company had built. Later we had implemented ASP.NET MVC Architecture. Later after
            2
            years, I have decided to move to another company to get myself challenges and learn more. In my second
            company, I started working on HTML/Bootstrap/AngularJS as the front-end and Python as the back-end language.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>
            In this phase, I have learned many technologies. I got many projects to work on. The major project includes
            the Sales reporting system, CRM system, AWS based data warehouse solution and many more. Eventually, I
            introduced myself to Quasar-Framework and Vue.js. After getting hands-on experience on Quasar-Framework for
            2
            years, I got involved in creating some plugins for Quasar Framework such as QDraggableHierarchy App
            Extension.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>
            Also, I do believe in Free or Open Source Software (FOSS) because I believe "Knowledge management doesnâ€™t
            happen until somebody reuses something". I am currently heavily involved in creating open source templates.
            You may have heard of some of my open-source resources:
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div>
            Quasar CRM Admin
            Quasar Scrum
            Quasar draggable tree (QDraggableTree)
            CoolTab chrome extension
          </div>
          I believe for sustaining in the market, you need to keep yourself updated with knowledge. Solution matters
          technology doesn't.
          <br/><br/>
          Stay tuned for more.
          <br/><br/>
          Thank you very much!
